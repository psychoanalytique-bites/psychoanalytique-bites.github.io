## <u>Transference Focused Psychotherapy : An Introduction</u> ##
### Sean, 07.01.2022 ###

Sean summarised the findings of Kernberg, et.al and their treatment of patients with Borderline Personality Disorder through a revised object-relations approach. The main paper that was of reference in this presentation was: 

Otto F. Kernberg, Frank E. Yeomans, John F. Clarkin & Kenneth N. Levy. (2008) *Transference focused psychotherapy: Overview and update*, The International Journal of Psychoanalysis, 89:3, 601-620, DOI: 10.1111/j.1745-8315.2008.00046.x

## <u>Beyond Thinking, Speaking and Dreaming : The Analytic Process of Psychoanalysis</u> ##
### Divya Ranjan, 17.01.2022 ###

This was first of three presentation in a series by Divya on some of the "foundations" in psychoanalysis. This was devoted to the subject of *analytic process* and introduces other things from scratch. The latter half of the presentation uses a case study from Ogden's work.
