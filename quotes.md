I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope\
For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love,\
For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith\
But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.\
Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:\
So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.\
Whisper of running streams, and winter lightning.\
The wild thyme unseen and the wild strawberry,\
The laughter in the garden, echoed ecstasy\
Not lost, but requiring, pointing to the agony\
Of death and birth.\

\"Am I in love? \--Yes, since I\'m waiting.\" The other never waits.
Sometimes I want to play the part of the one who doesn\'t wait; I try to
busy myself elsewhere, to arrive late; but I always lose at this game;
whatever I do, I find myself there, with nothing to do, punctual, even
ahead of time. The lover\'s fatal identity is precisely: *I am the one
who waits.*\

Love is deceptive because the subject who demands to be loved or who
imagines that he gives love fails to recognise that it is really desire
that is operating within the hollow of a demand for love. At the same
time the lover loves so that the other will see her or him how she or he
wants to be seen. Hence, what we often call love, for Lacan, is really
ignorance; and it is also hate.\

The truth of the matter is that---by an exorbitant paradox---I never
stop believing that I am loved. I hallucinate what I desire. Each wound
proceeds less from a doubt than from a betrayal: for only the one who
loves can betray, only the one who believes himself loved can be
jealous: that the other, episodically, should fail in his being, which
is to love me---that is the origin of all my woes. A delirium, however,
does not exist unless one wakens from it(there are only retrospective
deliriums): one day, I realize what has happened to me: I thought I was
suffering from not being loved, and yet it is because I thought I was
loved that I was suffering; I lived in the complication of supposing
myself simultaneously loved and abandoned. Anyone hearing my intimate
language would have had to exclaim, as of a difficult child: But after
all, what does he want?\

Let us suppose that I have wept, on account of some incident of which
the other has not even become aware (to weep is part of the normal
activity of the amorous body), and that, so this cannot be seen, I put
on dark glasses to mask my swollen eyes (a fine example of denial: to
darken the sight in order not to be seen). The intention of this gesture
is a calculated one: I want to keep the moral advantage of stoicism, of
"dignity" (I take myself for Clotilde de Vaux), and at the same time,
contradictorily, I want to provoke the tender question ("But what's the
matter with you?"); I want to be both pathetic and admirable, I want to
be at the same time a child and an adult. Thereby I gamble, I take a

What is the difference between someone who is psychotic and someone who

as it allows for a radical heterogeneity of the Other. But this love is

All speech is a request or demand for something we are missing, or at

heard, we are asking for our request to be recognized, we are asking to
be responded to, we are asking to be loved.\

The hysteric\'s fear is that, in so far as she is the object of the
Other\'s enjoyment, she is reduced to an instrument of the Other,
exploited, manipulated by him; on the other hand, there is nothing a
true pervert enjoys more than being an instrument of the Other, of his
jouissance. In a typical case of hysterical triangulation, while a wife
can fully enjoy illicit sex only, her message to her lover is: if her
husband learns of her affair and leaves her, she will also have to drop
him\... What we encounter here is the basic neurotic strategy of
snatching back from the other part of the jouissance he has taken from
us: by cheating her husband, she steak back from him part of the
jouissance he \'illegitimately\' stole from her. That is to say: a
neurotic has made the sacrifice of jouissance (which is why she is not a
psychotic), which enables her to enter the symbolic order, but she is
obsessed with the notion that the sacrificed jouissance, the jouissance
taken from her, is stored somewhere in the Other who is profiting from
it \'illegitimately\', enjoying in her place - so her strategy consists
in getting at least part of it back by transgressing the Other\'s norms
(from masturbating and cheating, up to speeding without getting a
ticket).\

Psychoanalysis in this version can\'t help people, because there is
nothing wrong with anybody; it can only engage them in useful and
interesting conversations. So one could then say that as a form of
treatment psychoanalysis is a conversation that enables people to
understand what stops them from having the kinds of conversation they
want, and how they come to believe that these particular conversations
are worth wanting. Rather than: psychoanalysis is a conversation that
helps people get back on track. Psychoanalysis, in other words, would be
a curiosity profession instead of a helping profession. It is of course
one of the tacit assumptions of psychoanalysis that there can be no good
life, and no curiousity, without talking.\

security. Each experience of love that has come my way has, I have
always told myself, been the last. What more logical than that? At the
outset of every falling in love there is an act of will. I know the
precise minute at which, deliberately and with full knowledge, I take
the fatal step forward. But how comes it, then, that I, with the traces

From the infant\'s point of view she should\
have taken into her, and thus experienced, the fear that the child was
dying. It was this fear that the child could not contain. He strove to
split it off together with the part of the personality in which it lay
and project it into the mother. An understanding mother is able to
experience the feeling of dread, that this baby was striving to deal
with by projective identification, and yet retain a balanced outlook.
This patient had had to deal with a mother who could not tolerate
experiencing such feelings and reacted either by denying them ingress,
or alternatively by becoming a prey to the anxiety which resulted from
introjection of the infant\'s feelings. The latter reaction must, I
think, have been rare: denial was dominant.\

Love thus stands in a complex relationship to reparation. Reparation is
made possible by love: first, in the sense that depressive guilt emerges
as a response to the infant's fear that they have attacked and destroyed

the depressive position is made possible by the primary caregiver's love
for the infant.\

All creation is really a re-creation of a once loved and once whole, but

the world within us is destroyed, when it is dead and loveless, when our

is then that we must re-create our world anew, reassemble the pieces,
infuse life into dead fragments, re-create life.\

It seems probable that depressive anxiety, guilt, and the reparative
tendency are only experienced when feelings of love for the object
predominate over destructive impulses. In other words, we may assume
that recurrent experiences of love surmounting hatred--- ultimately the
life instinct surmounting the death instinct---are an essential
condition for the ego's tendency to integrate itself and to synthesize
the contrasting aspects of the object.\

What does analysis uncover---if it isn't the fundamental, radical
discordance of forms of conduct essential to man in relation to
everything which he experiences? The dimension discovered by analysis is
the opposite of anything which progresses through adaptation, through
approximation, through being perfected. ... In man, it is the wrong form
which prevails. In so far as a task is not completed the subject returns
to it. The more abject the failure, the better the subject remembers
it.\

Don't you know that it's not longing for the maternal breast that
provokes anxiety, but its imminence? What provokes anxiety is everything
that announces to us, that lets us glimpse, that we're going to be taken
back onto the lap. It is not, contrary to what is said, the rhythm of
the mother's alternating presence and absence. The proof of this is that
the infant revels in repeating this game of presence and absence. The
security of presence is the possibility of absence. The most anguishing
thing for the infant is precisely the moment when the relationship upon
which he's established himself, of the lack that turns him into desire,
is disrupted, and this relationship is most disrupted when there's no
possibility of any lack, when the mother is on his back all the while,
and especially when she's wiping his backside. This is one model of
demand, of the demand that will never let up. ... Anxiety isn't about
the loss of the object, but its presence. The objects aren't missing.
... Once more, there's no lack.\

Further, it is easy to observe that libidinal object-cathexis does not
raise self-regard. The effect of dependence upon the loved object is to
lower that feeling: *a person in love is humble. A person who loves has,
so to speak, forfeited a part of his nar­cissism, and it can only be
replaced by his being loved.* In all these respects self-regard seems to
remain related to the narcis­sistic element in love.\

Conformity can be understood only in its particular context. Just as
magicians are the people who really know that there is no such thing as
magic, conformists can be the people who are not following the rules but
living by the magic of rules. Morality can be argued about and consented
to, whereas taboos can only be binding, or even spellbinding. Morality,
then, is about experimenting with morality; about engaging with it as an
ongoing conversation rather than as a rule book: morality as a way of
working out, of describing, what we really enjoy doing together.\

It is perhaps relevant here to cite the case of the child of the broken
home, or the child without parents. Such a child spends his time
unconsciously looking for his parents. It is notoriously inadequate to
take such a child into one\'s home and to love him. What happens is that
after a while a child so adopted gains hope, and then he starts to test
out the environment he has found, and to seek proof of his guardians\'
ability to hate objectively. It seems that he can believe in being loved
only after reaching being hated.\

A mother has to be able to tolerate hating her baby without doing
anything about it. She cannot express it to him. If, for fear of what
she may do, she cannot hate appropriately when hurt by her child she
must fall back on masochism, and I think it is this that gives rise to
the false theory of a natural masochism in women. The most remarkable
thing about a mother is her ability to be hurt so much by her baby and
to hate so much without paying the child out, and her ability to wait
for rewards that may or may not come at a later date. Perhaps she is
helped by some of the nursery rhymes she sings, which her baby enjoys
but fortunately does not understand?\

Does this not mean that the personality must be integrated before an
infant can be said to hate? However early integration may be
achieved\--perhaps integration occurs earliest at the height of
excitement or rage\--there is a theoretical earlier stage in which
whatever the infant does that hurts is not done in hate. I have used the
term \'ruthless love\' in describing this stage. Is this acceptable? As
the infant becomes able to feel to be a whole person, so does the word
hate develop meaning as a description of a certain group of his
feelings.\

Prior to integration of the personality there is aggression. A baby
kicks in the womb; it cannot be assumed that he is trying to kick his
way out. A baby of a few weeks thrashes away with his arms; it cannot be
assumed that he means to hit. A baby chews the nipple with his gums; it
cannot be assumed that he is meaning to destroy or to hurt. At origin
aggressiveness is almost synonymous with activity; it is a matter of

The transitional object has a distinct virtue: it does not exist.
Certainly, something exists that enables it to appear -- for example, a
teddy bear or cuddly toy. But what makes this teddy bear or cuddly toy
able to open up 'transitional space' -- which Winnicott also called
'potential space' -- in which the mother can encounter her child; what
makes this teddy bear or cuddly toy able to become the transitional
object, is that, beyond that part of the object that exists in external
space, beyond or beneath this piece of cloth, there holds something that
is precisely neither in exterior space, nor simply internal to either
the mother or the child.\
\
In this beyond or beneath of both the exterior and the interior, there
is something that holds between the mother and her child, and which
nevertheless does not exist. What takes hold between the mother and
child in not existing, but in passing through the transitional object,
and which therefore finds itself constituted by it, links and attaches
them to one another through a wonderful relationship: a relation of
love, of *amour fou*.\

How does a love end? ---Then it does end? To tell the truth, no
one---except for the others---ever knows anything about it; a kind of
innocence conceals the end of this thing conceived, asserted, *lived*
according to eternity. Whatever the loved being becomes, whether he
vanishes or moves into the realm of Friendship, in any case I never see
him disappear: the love which is over and done with passes into another
world like a ship into space. lights no longer winking: the loved being
once echoed loudly, now that being is entirely without resonance (the
other never disappears when and how we expect). This phenomenon results
from a constraint in the lover's discourse: I myself cannot (as an
enamored subject) construct my love story to the end: I am its poet (its
bard) only for the beginning; the end, like my own death, belongs to
others; it is up to them to write the fiction, the external, mythic
narrative.\

I am, therefore, alarmed by the other's fatigue: it is the cruelest of
all rival objects. How combat exhaustion? I can see that the other,
exhausted, tears off a fragment of this fatigue *in order to give it to
me*. But what am I to do with this bundle of fatigue set down before me?
What does this gift mean? *Leave me alone? Take care of me?* No one
answers, for what is given is precisely *what does not answer*.\

*Rien pour rien*. You get nothing for nothing. This formula, like any
formula in which the ambiguous *rien* occurs, seems to be the very
formula for *interest*, but it is also the formula for what is wholly
free of charge. Indeed, in the gift of love there is merely something
that is given for nothing, and which can only be nothing. In other
words, a subject gives something for free in so far as behind what he
gives there is everything he lacks.What constitutes the gift is that the
subject sacrifices beyond what he has.\

What intervenes in the love relationship, what is asked for as a sign of
love, is only ever something that carries worth merely as a sign. Or, to
go yet further, there is no greater possible gift, no greater sign of
love, than the gift of what one hasn\'t got.\
\
\[\....\]\
\
*The gift you give is always the gift you have received.* But when the
giving occurs between two subjects, the cycle of gifts comes from yet
elsewhere, because what establishes a love relationship is that the gift
is given, so to speak, for nothing.\

This is the terror: to have emerged from nothing, to have a name,
consciousness of self, deep inner feelings, an excruciating inner
yearning for life and self-expression---and with all this yet to die.\

What the self now lacks is surely reality---so one would commonly say,
as one says of a man that he has become unreal. But upon closer
inspection it is really necessity that man lacks.... What really is
lacking is the power to... submit to the necessary in oneself, to what
may be called one's limit. Therefore the misfortune does not consist in
the fact that such a self did not amount to anything in the world; no,
the misfortune is that the man did not become aware of himself, aware
that the self he is, is a perfectly definite something, and so is the
necessary. On the contrary, he lost himself, owing to the fact that this
self was seen fantastically reflected in the possible.\

We fear our highest possibility (as well as our lowest ones). We are

moments.... We enjoy and even thrill to the godlike possibilities we see
in ourselves in such peak moments. And yet we simultaneously shiver with
weakness, awe and fear before these very same possibilities.\

If the first love is indeed, as I hear it everywhere maintained to be,
the most delicious feeling which the heart of man, before it or after,
can experience, then our hero must be reckoned doubly happy, as
permitted to enjoy the pleasure of this chosen period in all its
fullness. Few men are so peculiarly favoured: by far the greater part
are led by the feelings of their youth into nothing but a school of
hardship, where, after a stinted and checkered season of enjoyment, they
are at length constraint to renounce their dearest wishes, and to learn
for ever to despise with what once hovered before them as the highest
happiness of existence.\

Nothing is more touching than the first disclosure of a love which has
been nursed in silence, of a faith grown strong in secret, and which at
last comes forth in the hour of need, and reveals itself to him who
formerly has reckoned it of small account. The bud, which had been
closed so long and firmly, was now ripe to burst into swathings; and
Wilhelm\'s heart could never have been readier to welcome the
impressions of affection.\

Take the child away from the fire, deny it a second piece of cake, but
avoid being angry or hurt or disapproving if a scream of rage or a kick
on the shins is the immediate consequence of thwarting a child's will to
happiness. To permit children to express their feelings of aggression,
whilst preventing acts of irremediable destruction is, we suggest, one
of the greatest gifts of parenting.\

..every advance in the process of mourning results in a deepening in the
individual's relation to his inner objects, in the happiness of
regaining them after they were felt to be lost. This is similar to the
way in which the young child step by step builds up his relation to
external objects, for he gains trust not only from pleasant experiences,
but also from the ways in which he overcomes frustrations and unpleasant
experiences, nevertheless retaining his good objects.\

What is the meaning of hate? It is not the absolute opposite of love;
that would be indifference, having no interest in a person, not wanting
a relationship and so having no reason for either loving or hating,
feeling nothing. Hate is love grown angry because of rejection. We can
only really hate a person if we want their love. Hate is an expression
of frustrated love needs, an attempt to destroy the bad rejecting side
of a person in the hope of leaving their good responsive side available,
a struggle to alter them. The anxiety is over the danger of hate
destroying both sides, and the easiest way out is to find two objects,
and love one and hate the other. But always hate is an
object-relationship.\

I identify myself in language, but only by losing myself in it as an

I am in the process of becoming.\

In order to achieve this in his development, *the child absolutely
requires an environment that is indestructible in essential respects*:
certainly carpets get dirtied and the walls have to be re-papered and an
occasional window gets broken, but somehow the home sticks together, and
behind all this is the confidence that the child has in the relationship
between the parents; the family is a going concern. When a deprivation
occurs in terms of a breakup of the home, especially an estrangement
between the parents, a very severe thing happens in the child's mental
organization. Suddenly his aggressive ideas and impulses become unsafe.
I think that what happens immediately is that the child takes over the
control that has been lost and becomes identified with the framework,
the result being that he loses his own impulsiveness and spontaneity.\

The infant that is blessed with a mother who survives, a mother who
knows a gift gesture when it is made, is now in a position to do
something about that hole, the hole in the breast or body, imaginatively
made in the original instinctual moment. Here come in the words
reparation and restitution, words which mean so much in the right
setting, but which can easily become cliches if used loosely. The gift
gesture may reach to the hole, if the mother plays her part.\

For believe me! --- the secret for harvesting from existence the

ships into uncharted seas! Live at war with your peers and yourselves!
Be robbers and conquerors as long as you cannot be rulers and
possessors, you seekers of knowledge! Soon the age will be past when you
could be content to live hidden in forests like shy deer! At long last
the search for knowledge will reach out for its due: --- it will want to
rule and possess, and you with it!\

The mother's role is the mother's desire. That's fundamental. The
mother's desire is not something that is bearable just like that, that
you are indifferent to. It will always wreak havoc. *A huge crocodile in
whose jaws you are --- that's the mother.* One never knows what might
suddenly come over her and make her shut her trap. That's what the
mother's desire is.\
\
\[\...\]\
\
There is a roller, made out of stone of course, which is there,
potentially, at the level of her trap, and it acts as a restraint, as a
wedge. It's what is called the phallus. It's the roller that shelters
you, if, all of a sudden, she closes it.\

The hypocrisy of neglected ideals has often been condemned as a major
sin; but in the moral world as in the romantic, *it is better to have
loved and lost than never to have loved*. The Athenians in their actions
were certainly as cruel, as dishonest, as greedy, as revengeful, as
irreligious, as other Greeks; but in their thoughts and aspirations many
of them loved and honoured justice, integrity, and generosity, and loved
their city as the shining embodiment of those virtues \-- which it was
not. Faith without works may be dead \-- but faith is seldom entirely
without works; and the works of the tragedians kept alive the faith of
Athenians in the beauty of goodness, and in what their city has
sometimes tried to be, even if success had been rare: the sanctuary of
Hellas.\

breath is: wind - and not even a constant, but all the time being
disgorged and sucked in again. That leaves the third part, the directing
mind. Quit your books - no more hankering: this is not your gift. No,

Man grows wings in melancholy not in order to enjoy the world but in
order to be alone. What is the meaning of loneliness in melancholy?
Isn\'t it related to the feeling of interior and exterior infinity? The
melancholy look is expressionless without perspective. The interior
finitude and vagueness of melancholy, not to be confused with the fecund
infinity of love, demands a space whose borders are ungraspable.
Melancholy is without clear or precise intentions, whereas ordinary
experience requires concrete objects and forms.\

The subject is barred here because he is a speaking subject, one who
relates to the other as the gaze \-- that is, to the imaginary other.
Whenever you come up against something that is a fantasy, strictly
speaking, you will see that it can be articulated in these primary
terms, qua relationship between the speaking subject and the imaginary
other. That is what defines a fantasy. The function of fantasy is to
provide the subject\'s desire with its propper level of correction or
situation. This is why human desire is fixed, attached and coapted, not
to an object, but always essentially to a fantasy.\

In other words, just as we must not say that the soul thinks, but like
Aristotle, that man thinks *with* his soul, we must say that the subject
defends himself with his ego. That is what psychoanalytic practice shows
us.\
\
The subject defends against his distress; and with the means given to
him by his imaginary experience of his relationship with the other, he
constructs something with the other that, unlike specular experience, is
flexible. In effect, what the subject reflects are not simply games of
bearing, and not simply his appearance to the other in \[the form of\]
prestige and feigning; it is himself as a speaking subject. This is why
fantasy is what I am designating to you here as the exit or reference
point by which desire learns to situate itself.\

A horizon of being is situated for the subject between, on the one hand,
the manifestations of his demand and what these manifestations have made
him become and, on the other hand, the demand to be recognized by the
Other, which we might, in this case, call the demand to be loved. We
want to know if he can reach that horizon or not.\
\
The experience of desire is situated in this interval or gap. it is
first apprehended as being experience of the Other\'s desire, and it is
within this experience that the subject has to situate his own desire.
His own desire can\'t be situated anywhere other than in this space.\

I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound or stab us.
If the book we\'re reading doesn\'t wake us up with a blow to the head,
what are we reading for? So that it will make us happy, as you write?
Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind
of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we
had to. But we need books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us
deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like
being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book
must be the axe for the frozen sea within us. That is my belief.\

There is from the beginning a constant interaction between these two
sources of anxiety, that is to say, between objective and neurotic
anxiety or in other words, anxiety from external and internal sources.
Furthermore, if external danger is from the beginning linked with
internal danger from the death instinct, no danger-situation arising
from external sources could ever be experienced by the young child as a
purely external and known danger.\

Womanliness therefore could be assumed and worn as a mask, both to hide
the possession of masculinity and to avert the reprisals expected if she
was found to possess it---much as a thief will turn out his pockets and
ask to be searched to prove that he has not the stolen goods. The reader
may now ask how I define womanliness or where I draw the line between
genuine womanliness and the \'masquerade\'. My suggestion is not,
however, that there is any such difference; whether radical or
superficial, they are the same thing. the capacity for womanliness was
there in this woman---and one might even say it exists in the most
completely homosexual woman---but owning to her conflicts it did not
represent her main development, and was used far more as a device for
avoiding anxiety than as a primary mode of sexual enjoyment.\

A psychoanalysis, consists in speaking freely, in not hushing the ideas
that go through your head. Little by little, from within your own words,
another meaning forms and surprises you, then falls apart, taking the
pain with it. Usually, you discover just how conditioned you had been by
apparently minute elements encountered in hazardous circumstances:
things from childhood, meetings, certain words said to you, and we keep
coming back to them until the malevolent charge of these elements
softens.\

As soon as anyone deliberately concentrates his attention to a certain
degree, he begins to select from the material before him, one point will
be fixed in his mind with particular cleanness and some other will be
correspondingly disregarded, and in making this selection he will be
following his expectations or inclinations. This, however, is precisely
what must not be done. In making the selection, if he follows his
expectation he is in danger of never finding anything but what he
already knows.\

How many times have I said to those under my supervision, when they say
to me---I had the impression he meant this or that---that one of the
things we must guard most against is to understand too much, to
understand more than what is in the discourse of the subject. To
interpret and to imagine one understands are not at all the same things.
It is precisely the opposite. I would go so far as to say that it is on
the basis of a kind of refusal of understanding that we push open the
door to analytic understanding.\

To put it in somewhat simplified terms: fantasy does not mean that when
I desire to eat a strawberry cake and cannot get it in reality, I
fantasize about eating it; the problem is, rather: *how do I know that I
desire a strawberry cake in the first place? This* is what fantasy tells
me. This role of fantasy hinges on the fact that \'there is no sexual
relationship\', no universal formula or matrix guaranteeing a harmonious
sexual relationship with one\'s partner: because of the lack of this
universal formula, every subject has to invent a fantasy of his or her
own, a \'private\' formula for the sexual relationship---for a man, the
relationship with a woman is possible only inasmuch as she fits his
formula.\

What, then, is semblance? Imagine that a man is having an affair about
which his wife doesn\'t know, so that when he is meeting his lover, he
pretends to be on a business trip, or something similar, after some
time, he summons up his courage and tells his wife the truth: when he is
away, he is in fact with his lover--- at this point, however, when the
semblance of a happy marriage falls apart, the mistress breaks down an,
out of sympathy with the abandoned wife, starts to avoid her lover. What
should the husband do now in order to give his wife the wrong
signal---not to let her think that the fact that he is no longer on
business trips so often means that he is coming back to her? He has to
*fake* the affair, leave home for a couple of days, thus generating the
mistaken impression that the affair is still on, while in reality he is
just staying with a friend. This is semblance at its purest: *it occurs
not when we erect a deceptive screen to conceal our transgression, but
when we pretend that there is a transgression to be concealed*.\

We must not imagine Sisyphus happy, nor sad, nor emotional, we must not
imagine Sisyphus at all, for to do so is to realize Sisyphus understood
his predicament long ago and he has since become an agent who believes
his lie, the lie that pushing the boulder, again and again, is good and
correct; if one stands close to Sisyphus at the end of his working day,
they'll hear him utter his favorite pop-quote 'C'est la vie!'.\

There is only one state --- admittedly an unusual state, but not one
that can be stigmatized as pathological --- in which it does not do
this. At the height of being in love the boundary between ego and object
threatens to melt away. Against all the evidence of his senses, a man
who is in love declares that 'I' and 'you' are one, and is prepared to
behave as if it were a fact. What can be temporarily done away with by a
physiological \[i.e., normal\] function must also, of course, be liable
to be disturbed by pathological processes. Pathology has made us
acquainted with a great number of states in which the boundary lines
between the ego and the external world become uncertain or in which they
are actually drawn incorrectly.\

Without giving away the tremendous importance of finding the origins of
a person's distress in the person and in the person's past history and
inner reality, it has become necessary to admit or even to claim that in
matters of ultimate aetiology, the important thing is the environment.
In other words, if the environment is good enough, then the individual
baby, small child, growing child, older child and adolescent has the
chance to grow according to the potential that is inherited.\

How tiresome it is to give up pursuits to which we have become attached.
A man enjoying a happy home-life has only to see a woman who attracts
him, or spend five or six pleasant days gambling, and he will be very

Curiosity is only vanity. We usually only want to know something so that

The result is that anyone who has an interest in winning our affection
avoids rendering us a service which he knows to be unwelcome; *we are
treated as we want to be treated; we hate the truth and it is kept from
us; we desire to be flattered and we are flattered; we like being
deceived and we are deceived.*\

No one talks about us in our presence as he would in our absence. Human
relations are only based on this mutual deception; and few friendships
would survive if everyone knew what his friend said about him behind his
back, even though he spoke sincerely and dispassionately.\
\
Man is therefore nothing but disguise, falsehood and hypocrisy, both in
himself and with regard to others. He does not want to be told the
truth. He avoids telling it to others, and all these tendencies, so
remote from justice and reason, are naturally rooted in his heart.\

\"So *this* you see was the thing for which during these last three
years all the alerts and forewarnings of my watchful nature have been
preparing me: but now my nature will have a very, very hard time
surviving, since during this long interval it has exhausted itself in
acts of help and correction and imperceptible adjustment; and before the
present infinitely painful state with all its complications began to
develop, it had undergone with me an insidious intestinal flu. And now,
Lou, I know not *how many hells*, you know how I made a place for pain,
for physical pain, the truly great one, in my accommodations, but only
as an exception and as already a first step back into the open. And now.
It encases me. It supplants me. Day and night!\

One of the things we do and don't want to know about ourselves is how we
are unavoidably changing, and how we might want to change. There is, in
our more modern, secular languages, the double life of biological
destiny and self-invention, and the double life of what you think you
know, and want to know, about yourself, and what you don't want to know
about yourself (what is conscious and what is, as yet, unconscious).
What is being converted (and apparently cured) in conversion experiences
are contradictions such as these. It is not, though, that the problem is
solved; it is that to all intents and purposes it disappears.\

Where are we at forty years later? What Lacan said in the 1970s has
become quite obvious. We are in the midst of what I have called the
reign of "narcynism," condensing narcissism and cynicism, to indicate a
state of the society where, in the absence of grand causes that
transcend the individual, in the absence of class solidarity, no one any
longer has any possible cause than himself. And in fact, a great outcry
is being heard everywhere deploring the ills of capitalism, including
the widespread precariousness not only of work but also of the bonds of
love, friendship, and family, not to mention the absence of meaning, and
the solitude that leaves people, so to speak ... lost. A sign of
the times.\

To the love-hungry schizoid faced internally with an exciting but
deserting object all relationships are felt to be \'swallowing-up
things\' which trap and imprison and destroy. *If your hate is
destructive you are still free to love because you can find someone else
to hate. But if you feel your love is destructive the situation is
terrifying.* You are always *impelled into* a relationship by your needs
and at once *driven out* again by the fear either of exhausting your
love-object by the demands you want to make or else losing your own
individuality by over-dependence and identification. This \'in and out\'
oscillation is the *typical schizoid behaviour*, and to escape from it
into detachment and loss of feeling is the *typical schizoid state*.\

Although healthy persons communicate and enjoy communicating, the other
fact is equally true, that each individual is an isolate, permanently
non-communicating, permanently unknown, in fact unfound. . . . At the
centre of each person is an incommunicado element \.... The violation of
the self\'s core, the alteration of the self\'s central elements by
communication seeping through the defences: for me this would be the sin
against the self\.... The question is: *how to be isolated without
having to be insulated?*\

Whenever I read a book - whatever I have done prior to my reading and
whatever I do subsequently - someone is communicating with me in their
absence. Rather like a dream, I am hearing things, but there is no
sound. Modern technology masks how truly incredible it is that people
can communicate with us in their absence and after their deaths. Of
course, we want something from these people who aren\'t really there. So
what difference does a person in the room make? What difference does
actually talking and listening make? To put it more psychoanalytically,
what is simply reading a book a re-creation of that analysis can never
be, by virtue of the presence of that so-called real other person?
*There is, one might say, a self one is true to in solitude, and a self
one is true to in company.*\

So it becomes understandable that the sex which in a patriarchal society
has for so long been deprived of its own voice---and what could be more
essential than the right to speak?---seems to have a special affinity
for hysteria. This lack of acknowledgement is conveyed to them either by
the inequalities they perceive to exist between their parents or
siblings by virtue of their gender, or by the accidents of seduction or
abuse which leave them with a sense of oppression and vulnerability and
tempt them to have recourse to the mechanisms of repression or
dissociation which again can be found at the root of many adults\'
symptoms of hysteria.\

Considering mental illness an individual chemico-biological problem has
enormous benefits for capitalism. First, it reinforces Capital\'s drive
towards atomistic individualization (you are sick because of your brain
chemistry). Second, it provides an enormously lucrative market in which
multinational pharmaceutical companies can peddle their pharmaceuticals
(we can cure you with our SSRIs). It goes without saying that all mental
illnesses are neurologically *instantiated*, but this says nothing about
their *causation*. If it is true, for instance, that depression is
constituted by low serotonin levels, what still needs to be explained is
why particular individuals have low levels of serotonin. This requires a
social and political explanation; and the task of re-politicizing mental
illness is an urgent one if the left wants to challenge capitalist
realism.\

One hates when one\'s survival is threatened: born helpless as we are,
anything that echoes that predicament evokes hate; anything that saves
us from it evokes love. The hate can end when the threat to survival is
removed. Love can come in its place---but when one\'s love for another
is suddenly exposed to the possibility that the person may annihilate
one, then the love itself can turn to hate.\

Good Lord, only a *moment* of bliss? Isn\'t such a moment sufficient for
the whole of a man\'s life?\

Meaning is always ambiguous, polyvalent, betraying something one wanted
to remain hidden, hiding something one intended to express.\

The depressive experiences himself as walled off from the lifeworld, so
that his own frozen inner life -- or inner death -- overwhelms
everything; at the same time, he experiences himself as evacuated,
totally denuded, a shell: there is nothing except the inside, but the
inside is empty. For the depressive, the habits of the former lifeworld
now seem to be, precisely, a mode of playacting, a series of pantomime
gestures ('a circus complete with all fools'), which they are both no
longer capable of performing and which they no longer wish to perform --
there's no point, everything is a sham.\

..The true Schopenhauerian moments are those in which you achieve your
goals, perhaps realise your long-cherished heart's desire -- and feel
cheated, empty, no, more -- or is it less? -- than empty, voided.\

Satiation is the point at which you must face the existential revelation
that you didn't want really want what you seemed so desperate to have,
that your most urgent desires are only a filthy vitalist trick to keep
the show on the road. If you 'can't replace the fear or the thrill of
the chase', why stir yourself to pursue yet another empty kill? Why
carry on with the charade?\

The depressive is always confident of one thing: that he is without

It is the analyst\'s task constantly to tear the patient out of his
menacing illusion and to show him again and again that what he takes to
be new real life is the reflection of the past. And lest he should fall
into a state in which he is inaccessible to all evidence, the analyst
takes care that neither the love nor the hostility reach an extreme
height. This is effected by preparing him in good time for the
possibilities and by not overlooking the first signs of hate.\

As psychoanalysts are so often inclined to remind us, babies are born in
a totally helpless state and have to struggle with their own drives and
the sensations in their bodies. Anyone who\'s spent any amount of time
with a baby knows that they\'re frequently upset; they scream, cry, and
make a fuss. If you\'re the person looking after that baby you have to
try to work out what they\'re getting at. The way in which you interpret
their suffering will inevitably say more about *you* than it does about
them. You might imagine they\'re hungry whereas they actually have a
pain in their body. You think they\'re too hot but actually they\'re
thirsty. You act on the baby until it stops screaming. The baby tries to
tolerate the unbearable fact of its existence while you respond to it in
whatever way you think is appropriate. In this way, you inevitably
become bound up with whatever the baby is feeling. The things you do
form its experience of the world. You put your marks on the baby, touch
it, speak to it, clean it and abandon it in whtever combination you
choose. In this way, you begin to inscribe jouissance on it.\

By responding to the baby, you help it to tame and order its drives. You
teach it to inhabit its own body, to turn the hideous sensations into
ejoyment, although this enjoyment is never easy; it\'s always in
relation to the horror, discomfort and helplessness it\'s formed out of.
The baby comes to access an enjoyment of its own body through the
signifiers of the mother, or primary carer. The carer becomes so
intimately bound up with this jouissance that they appear to be the
cause of it. The child\'s suffering is somehow outsourced. the baby
externalizes the problem by holding the mother/carer responsible for the
sensations it experiences. She becomes scary, becaue the baby needs her
to be like that. Better that *she\'s* scary than that the scariness is
intrinsic to existence. Having made her into something dreadful, it then
just needs to make its father into a person who can save it.
Abracadabra, all the badness is gone!\

We are faced with a crisis of the Symbolic, and therefore also a crisis
of sexuality i.e. cries for libidinal recognition, anxiety over one's
body, obsession towards certain kinds of bodies, a retreat into
obsessive virtual sexuality, and so on\
\
A driving force behind this situation is the idea of cuteness, in which
the Subject and their surroundings must become cute (flat, childlike,
casual, allegedly ultimately harmless) by acquiring specified signifiers
and characteristics. On the internet today, everything is cute: from
user avatars, gamified metrics on social media, racist memes on 4chan,
to Tinder matches. This cuteness, with elements that are heavily drawn
from Japanese otaku culture, masks a form of violence through which the
Subject is turned into sanitised images, data points, and flat
signifiers, vulnerable and reductive, instead of being regarded in their
complex contradictions and ambivalence. This is reflected in our
day-to-day usage of the labels 'cringe' (when one tries too hard) and
'creepy' (when one comes too close), as well as a general mode of
relating online where subjects are united in a hatred of the Other's
jouissance as they are encouraged to congregate around shared signifiers
(in relation to identity, sexual orientation, or politics) on social
media---all striving to become one-dimensional, childlike avatars of
oneself exorcised of depth.\

Your waking life is a life of toil even when you think that you are
doing nothing, for at every instant you must choose and at every instant
exclude. You choose---and with extreme precision and subtlety---between
remembrances, rejecting any remembrance which will not fit in exactly
with your present state. The choice that you are forever exercising, the
adaptation that you are forever exercising, the adaptation that you are
forever in the process of making, is the first and most important
attribute of what is called good sense. But all this keeps you in a
state of uninterrupted tension. You don\'t feel it at this very moment
any more than you feel atmospheric pressure, but in the long run you
become tired. Good sense is tiresome.\

Henri Bergson, *The World of Dreams*.
