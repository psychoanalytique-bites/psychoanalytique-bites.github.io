# PSYCHOANALYTIC BYTES

![Freud at IPA Congress 1920, Netherlands.](./img/in24.jpg "margin Freud")

>> ...these psychoanalytical matters are intelligible only if presented in pretty full and complete detail, just as an analysis really gets going only when the patient descends to minute details from the abstractions which are their surrogate. Thus discretion is incompatible with a satisfactory description of an analysis;  to provide the latter one would have to be unscrupulous, give away, betray, behave like an artist who buys paints with his wife's house-keeping money or uses the furniture as firewood to warm the studio for his model. Without a trace that kind of unscrupulousness the job cannot be done.

Psychoanalysis is about conversations, yet as Adam Phillips has pointed out, much of psychoanalytic works resist conversations from happening. This is not necessarily a critique to psychoanalysis itself but rather the way psychoanalysts have written about their work. The goal here is to mitigate some of that, to work as a group on making conversations around psychoanalysis accessible through presentations, open-ended discussions, and much more. These attempts are meant to be self-contained and "bite-sized" thus "Psychoanalytique Bites".

Other than making things "accessible", one of the other goals is to form bridges across different schools of psychoanalysis. This allows us to find similarities, differences, places of potential improvements and so on from radically different ways of practice.

We welcome you in joining us and making conversations happen!
